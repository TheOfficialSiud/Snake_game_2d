# Minesweeper_game_2d
I have created the Minesweeper game using unity handler and add the functionalities using c#.

if you want to run the file just download the build folder zip and extract in your local drive.
Then run the snakegame.exe file.

you can control the spedd of snake and spawning of food by slider.
